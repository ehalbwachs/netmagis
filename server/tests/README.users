Through these tests, we use some groups and users defined in the example
data for netmagis-dbimport (see server/examples/with-views/).

Each user 'u<n>-<name>' belongs to a group 'g<n>-<name>' which defines
its access rights. During the initial database loading test, some API
tokens are added ('t<n>-<name>').

This file gives a summary of rights defined for these groups:
    g1-wheel	access to 172.16/16 and 198.51.100/24 and example.{com,org}
		and views external and internal, and all specific rights
		(mac, ttl, smtp, etc.)
    g2-simple	access restricted to example.com, 172.16/16 and view
		internal only, no specific right
    g3-genz	access to nothing, but right to generate zones/dhcp/etc
    g4-mac	same as g2-simple, with added right to use the mac module
    g5-ttl	same as g2-simple, with added right to change ttl value
    g6-smtp	same as g1-wheel, with the only smtp specific right
    g7-admin	same as g2-simple, with the admin right
    g8-absent	same as g2-simple (used only for the u8-absent user)
